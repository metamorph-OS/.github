# Welcome
Compliance and governance are two closely related topics that can be found nearly everywhere in society. They can have devastating consequences if not conducted properly. Due to the many forms in which they come and the weight of the requirements, finding a generic solution to this issue is a complex matter.

This is the field of metamorphOS, the governance and compliance engine. It is an operating system that enforces compliance on execution and preserves historical records immutably, providing integrity, accountability and traceability.

It can be utilized for any kind of coordination and state management. The system is designed with the need of adaption in mind, which allows it to evolve. Using all features of metamorphOS it can constitute a sovereign single-source-of-truth.

metamorphOS is realized as a headless white-label SaaS and on-premise solution.
